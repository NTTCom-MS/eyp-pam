## Overview

PAM modules and /etc/security/limits.conf management

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What pam affects

* /etc/security/limits.conf
* system-auth config (/etc/pam.d)

### Setup Requirements

This module requires pluginsync enabled

### Beginning with pam

#### limits

```puppet
class { "limits": }

limits::limit { "nofile *":
  domain => "*",
  item => 'nofile',
  value => '123456',
}

limits::limit { "nproc *":
  domain => "*",
  item => 'nproc',
  value => '123456',
}
```

This will generate the following entries:

```
* - nofile 123456
* - nproc 123456
```

## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing
the fancy stuff with your module here.

## Reference

### defines

#### pam::limit

 * core - limits the core file size (KB)
 * data - max data size (KB)
 * fsize - maximum filesize (KB)
 * memlock - max locked-in-memory address space (KB)
 * nofile - max number of open files
 * rss - max resident set size (KB)
 * stack - max stack size (KB)
 * cpu - max CPU time (MIN)
 * nproc - max number of processes
 * as - address space limit (KB)
 * maxlogins - max number of logins for this user
 * maxsyslogins - max number of logins on the system
 * priority - the priority to run user process with
 * locks - max number of file locks the user can hold
 * sigpending - max number of pending signals
 * msgqueue - max memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes)
 * nice - max nice priority allowed to raise to values: [-20, 19]
 * rtprio - max realtime priority
 * chroot - change root to directory (Debian-specific)
* value: value for item

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

We are pushing to have acceptance testing in place, so any new feature should
have some test to check both presence and absence of any feature
